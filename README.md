This is a collection of various small projects / toy programs I am currently writing to learn Rust. Includes:
- cat_rs: a simple implementation of [cat](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/cat.1.html) in Rust
- ttt: a simple tic-tac-toe game to learn more about structs, impls, error handling etc.
